## About the Game 🎮

**Floodead** is a browser-based horror survival game created using **Three.js**, a powerful JavaScript 3D library. The game leverages WebGL and GLSL shaders to deliver immersive water effects, lighting, and fog directly in your browser. The monster AI, environmental effects, and gameplay logic are all built with JavaScript, providing an atmospheric, real-time 3D experience.

## Story Synopsis 📖

After a massive earthquake triggers a tsunami and storm, you wake up trapped inside a flooded office building. Injured by falling debris, you find yourself alone in the dark, with rising floodwaters threatening your survival. But worse, a giant monster, stranded alongside you, stalks the corridors. Your goal is to explore the building, collect clues, and find a way to escape before the flood and the beast close in.
