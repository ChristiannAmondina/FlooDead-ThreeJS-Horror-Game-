## About the Game 🎮

**Floodead** is a browser-based horror survival game built using **Three.js**, a 3D graphics library that runs directly in the browser via WebGL. The game simulates a haunting flood scenario enhanced by dynamic water effects, fog, eerie lighting, and real-time monster AI. Built with JavaScript and shaders, this experience offers tension, atmosphere, and exploration — all in the browser.

## Story Synopsis 📖

After a catastrophic earthquake triggers a massive tsunami and storm, you're trapped inside a flooded office building. You wake up injured and alone, surrounded by darkness and rising waters. But you're not alone — something monstrous was swept in with the flood.  
Explore your surroundings, uncover clues, and find a way to escape — before the flood (and the beast) finds you first.
